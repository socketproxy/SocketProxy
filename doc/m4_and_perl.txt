I have a small amount of code shared between the Perl programs in Socket
Proxy. I recognize that this code will change over time so I've split
it out and put it into the src/shared directory. There, instead of creating
a Perl module which is used by both programs, I've made it a stub file which
I include using the m4 text processor.

This is a questionable design decision. Here's why I made it.

One of the Perl programs that relies on this shared code, soxprox-agent, 
is mobile code, meant to be uploaded to a victim computer and executed
surreptitiously. To be most effective, it must be a text file that can 
execute on as many systems as possible. Any code that gets uploaded must be
"compiled" into the same file.

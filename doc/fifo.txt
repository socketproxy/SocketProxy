pseudocode for the fifo:

server.pl
fork and create agent
fork and create client
server  mkfifo(/tmp/soxprox.PPID.PID/command)
server  opens command fifo for reading.
client library handles socket request by writing to command fifo.
server reads command fifo and passes request to agent.
agent returns with socket info (if any)
server sets up another fifo (/tmp/soxprox.PPID.PID/socket.1)
server returns socket info to client library
client library opens the socket fifo and returns that file descriptor.

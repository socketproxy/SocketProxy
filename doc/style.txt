For C, K&f&R without the tabs. This is not my personal fave but it's easy
to do with indent. I've got a .indent.pro file and a 'make pretty' production
that's ready to rock.

For Perl, use the perltidy default, plus limiting line length to 75 chars. As
with C, there's a profile for this in .perltidyrc in the src/agent and 
src/server directories.

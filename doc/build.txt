The build system of SocketProxy needs to be able to handle a few things:
 o Compile executables from C source code
 o Compile libraries from C source code
 o Manage Perl scripts and libraries as appropriate
 o Be cross-platform as much as I want, maybe more
 o Compile/Create and execute unit test suites
 o Manage source code analysis routines (lint, valgrind, etc.)
 o Manage revision control
 o Support continuous integration as necessary
 o deployment
 o packaging via .tgz, .deb, .rpm
 o Clean up executables

As of now I don't do half of the above, but I plan to. I want my build system
to be there for me.

Some things I'll be looking at:
 o gmake
 o autoconf
 o 

This may require that I move some files around. That's fine. I started with
git for a reason. If I were on SVN or some such I wouldn't be fussing with
a build system right now, I'd be moving from SVN to git.

Cross-platform support is not a thing that I'm concerned with today, but
I'd like to start addressing it now while it's cheap so that I don't have
to begin when it's expensive.
